God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives.
    One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.
    That which does not kill us makes us stronger. Without music, life would be a mistake.
    Man is something that shall be overcome. What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.
    The higher we soar, the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly. In individuals, insanity is rare.
    He who has a why to live can bear almost any how. To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.

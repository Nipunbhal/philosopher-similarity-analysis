Beauty in things exists in the mind which contemplates them. Reason is the slave of the passions.
    Custom is the great guide of human life. The life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster.
    A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence. Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous.
    It is not reason which is the guide of life, but custom. Habit and custom have a mighty influence over mankind.
    No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact.
    Morals excite passions and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular.

Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.
    We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
    The more you know, the more you know you don't know. It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.
    Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom. Quality is not an act, it is a habit.
    The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Man is by nature a social animal.
    Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work. Hope is a waking dream.
